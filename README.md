# VRP Optimization using Genetic Algorithm and Multi-Agent Systems

**Optimizing Vehicle Routing Problems (VRPs) through Genetic Algorithms and Multi-Agent Systems.**

## Description

This project involves:

1. Applying a **Genetic Algorithm** for initial route optimization.
2. Utilizing a **Multi-Agent System** to further optimize routes through node exchange.
3. Analyzing if node exchanges **decrease travel distances**.
